              <h1>About me and blog</h1>
              <p>First of all, I’m not really Beter. I just like her from The Simpsons. I’m in love with her. She is so cool. I would let her ride my belly button all night. Okay, I think we’re getting a little off track. But what I wanted to say is that I’m not really in a corner, I just said that so it would be as close as possible to the name of Sweden’s most famous talk show, “Hellenius Hörna”. Hörna means corner in swedish. I like trains on the water and boats on the track. I’m mowing the lawn tomorrow, so I better wrap this up soon. Well that was all I had to say. Now you know a little about me, the founder of Consuela’s Corner.</p>

              <h1>Why I made this blog</h1>
              <p>Why did I make this blog? Well, it’s kind of complicated. I just thought that I would make a blog to shit out all of my thoughts. I just think of something and I do it. I never start to overthink. My blog is like a toilet for my thoughts.</p>
