                <p>Why is rice so expensive? I mean I just want to make some pot brownies BUT I CANNOT AFFORD THE RICE! But while we’re at it, what is rices anyways? Is it some kind of fruit?
                   Wait, is that what’s in the maracas? All i know is that I can’t afford it anymore. Maybe I have to go get it myself from the rice trees. Or what if I take a grain of rice and plant it in my living room, then I would have an unlimited source of rice. That would be great. I Iove rice. Or do I? I don’t really know, I’m kinda high.</p>

                <p>I want to get the new Boba fett set so bad. Imagine having him just standing there in your kitchen, keeping an eye out for intruders. Shooting them if they didn't bring cookies. God, that would be awesome, more awesome than those straws that I throw in the ocean. Everyone says the turtles are choking on them but that's just bullcrap. Turtles love straws, just like I love my coffeemaker. Damn the coffee becomes delicious with that thing. Without cocain I can't fall asleep at    night.</p>

                <p>You're mad, Consuela is back. Nah, im just pledging your balls. What I really wanted to say is that I can't afford washing products anymore. I'm really depressed and on top of that
my husband left me. I'm starting a kickstarter for my kids to survive. But hey, that's life sometimes. And by the way it's summer now and im planning on cleaning my house for the fourth
time today. But FUCK IM MAD AT PEDER GRIFFIN. He's playing that fucking song "surfin' bird" all the pledging time. My lemons are dry and the cocaine farm is down the drain.
Back to Beter, that fat plog probably has diabetes type 7 or some shit. Like my fat nephew "Diabeto". He can't even fit in the lazy river! HHAHHAHHA HE'S SO DISGU- i mean fat. Merry fucking christmas.</p>
